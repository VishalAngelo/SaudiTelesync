# SaudiTelesync_BIA_Mini_Project
Dive into STC, Saudi Arabia's telecom giant! This mini Use Case-Business Intelligence Analytics project explores their strengths, challenges, and ambitions from digital transformation to regional expansion. 
A business use case describes a specific task or activity within a business, outlining the steps involved and who performs them. By understanding these use cases, businesses can improve efficiency, identify any issues, and ensure everyone is on the same page.
